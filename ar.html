    <h2>ARTIFFICIAL INTALLIGANCE COURSE</h2>
    <div class=para>
        <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural intelligence
            displayed by humans or animals. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents":
            any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its
            goals. Some popular accounts use the term "artificial intelligence" to describe machines that mimic
            "cognitive" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem solving",
            however this definition is rejected by major AI researchers.

            AI applications include advanced web search engines, recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon and
            Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri or Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g. Tesla), and competing
            at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go), As machines become increasingly
            capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from the definition of AI, a
            phenomenon known as the AI effect. For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded
            from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology.

            Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since has
            experienced several waves of optimism, followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an
            "AI winter"), followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding. AI research has tried
            and discarded many different approaches during its lifetime, including simulating the brain, modeling human
            problem solving, formal logic, large databases of knowledge and imitating animal behavior. In the first
            decades of the 21st century, highly mathematical statistical machine learning has dominated the field, and
            this technique has proved highly successful, helping to solve many challenging problems throughout industry
            and academia.

            The various sub-fields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools.
            The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning,
            natural language processing, perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects. General
            intelligence (the ability to solve an arbitrary problem) is among the field's long-term goals. To solve
            these problems, AI researchers use versions of search and mathematical optimization, formal logic,
            artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, probability and economics. AI also draws upon
            computer science, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and many other fields.

            The field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence "can be so precisely described that a
            machine can be made to simulate it". This raises philosophical arguments about the mind and the ethics of
            creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence. These issues have been explored by myth,
            fiction and philosophy since antiquity. Science fiction and futurology have also suggested that, with
            its enormous potential and power, AI may become an existential risk to humanity.
