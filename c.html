    <h2>C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE COURSE</h2>
    <div class="para">
        <p>A successor to the programming language B, C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie between
            1972 and 1973 to construct utilities running on Unix. It was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the
            Unix operating system. During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. It has become one of the most
            widely used programming languages, with C compilers from various vendors available for the majority of
            existing computer architectures and operating systems. C has been standardized by ANSI since 1989 (ANSI C)
            and by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

            C is an imperative procedural language. It was designed to be compiled to provide low-level access to memory
            and language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, all with minimal runtime support.
            Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming. A
            standards-compliant C program written with portability in mind can be compiled for a wide variety of
            computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code.

            As of January 2021, C was ranked first in the TIOBE index, a measure of the popularity of programming
            languages, moving up from the no. 2 spot the previous year.
