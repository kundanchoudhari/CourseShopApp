    <h2>JAVA PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE COURSE</h2>
    <div class=para>
        <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few
            implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let
            application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all
            platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled
            to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer
            architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of
            them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that
            are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular
            programming languages in use according to GitHub, particularly for client-server web applications,
            with a reported 9 million developers.

            Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle)
            and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and reference
            implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under
            proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process,
            Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GPL-2.0-only license. Oracle offers its own
            HotSpot Java Virtual Machine, however the official reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free
            open-source software and used by most developers and is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions.

            As of March 2021, the latest version is Java 16, with Java 11, a currently supported long-term support (LTS)
            version, released on September 25, 2018. Oracle released the last zero-cost public update for the legacy
            version Java 8 LTS in January 2019 for commercial use, although it will otherwise still support Java 8 with
            public updates for personal use indefinitely. Other vendors have begun to offer zero-cost builds of OpenJDK
            8 and 11 that are still receiving security and other upgrades.

            Oracle (and others) highly recommend uninstalling outdated versions of Java because of serious risks due to
            unresolved security issues. Since Java 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, and 15 are no longer supported, Oracle advises
            its users to immediately transition to the latest version (currently Java 16) or an LTS release.
